## Model Optimization Process
### Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision tree algorithms. It creates a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the mean/average prediction of the individual trees. Random Forest can capture complex non-linear patterns without needing transformations.
